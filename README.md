# ba-real-estate

Analysis and modeling of real estate market in Bosnia and Herzegovina

## About

This project consists of two parts: `lab` and `webapp`, contained in their own directories.

The lab module contains Jupyter notebooks analyzing real estate data pulled from [OLX.ba](https://olx.ba), and creating a model of prices for apartments for sale.  
The webapp module contains simple Streamlit app where users can select apartment features, like size, city, etc., and will get predicted price, generated by the best model from the modeling notebook.  
The `models` and `helpers` directories contain files used by both modules.

## Installation

The entire app can be ran locally using docker.  
Just clone the repository and run `docker compose up --build --detach` from the root directory.  
Once the containers have been set up, you can visit `localhost:8000` to view the app, and `localhost:8001` to open Jupyter Lab and play around with the notebooks.
